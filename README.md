You can then click on the 'Register' button if you are a new Haven user. Inside the Registration section, you can swipe left or right to move from page to page or press the 'Continue' button. When filling incorrect information into the 'Text Fields', the 'Text Fields' will shake and a popup message will appear. At the end of Registering, your information will be sent to Haven's custom backend. Then, Haven will automatically create your account and log you into the Haven app.
